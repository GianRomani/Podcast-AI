I'm saying it wrong. I'm sorry. Ilaria Baldwin. So I just can't wrap my head around this story. So if you don't know who I mean, I'm talking about, this is Alec Baldwin's wife, okay? And I met her years ago. Backstage at SNL, Alec was like, I want you to meet my wife. And I saw her, and I said, no, thank you. I'm trying to hang on to my self-esteem, okay? She is a tiny Disney princess, and I look like Ben Rafflesburger from most angles. She came over. She said, I'm Ilaria from Espa\u00f1a. Very thick Spanish accent, okay? From Spain. And you know, you might have seen her on a morning show doing a cooking demonstration where she had trouble remembering how to pronounce the word. How you say, cucumber? And she was wearing a dress on a different show. They said, where's your dress? She said, I don't know if you have this store in the U.S. It's from Zara. They have a von Trapp amount of children, and they name them all, I'm not sure, but very Spanish names like jam\u00f3n and croqueta and flamenco, you know? And all of this would be fine and beautiful, except that Ilaria from Espa\u00f1a is actually Hillary from Boston. This woman is in no way Spanish. Her parents are not from Spain. No one in her life is from Spain. You're going, what? Did you think I was just doing a really racist Spanish impression for like 15 minutes? You're like, wow. Wow. So I'm not trying to bully a sociopath. I have a point, okay? So I think what had happened was, I think she went to Spain. Okay, because again, I cannot tell you how much her family is not from Spain. They were early settlers in the U.S. I'm not fucking with you. They were on the Mayflower. That's how much this chick is from Boston. But I think what had happened was she went to Spain. I've been lucky enough to go to Spain. Some of you have been. It's great, right? Don't you love it? I loved it too. I'm from the artillery from Boston. Fucking love you. I am going to be from it. Did you know you can just decide where you're from? Like on my driver's license, it says that I am from Splash Mountain. Isn't that great? Libby, do you ever go on a vacation and have a good time? Where? Where'd you go? Mexico. Mexico? You're from there. Enjoy. Enjoy. So here's my point, okay? I actually have a point, okay? My point is that all evidence points to this woman, since she met her husband, has straight up pretended to be from Spain. And her husband shot someone. Now stay with me. Stay with me. My point is neither of them give a fuck. Find someone who can stand you."}, "podcast_summary": "The podcast transcript discusses the controversy surrounding Ilaria Baldwin, the wife of Alec Baldwin.
